# Real-Time Chat Application with Speech-to-Text and Face Matching

A full-stack real-time chat application that provides secure authentication using face recognition, real-time messaging with WebSockets, group chat management, and integrated speech-to-text functionality. This application leverages AWS Rekognition for face matching and Google Speech-to-Text API for audio transcription.

## Overview

This application is designed to provide a secure and interactive chatting experience. Users register by creating an account (name, email, and password) and are prompted to capture a selfie using their webcam. This image is processed with AWS Rekognition and securely stored as part of the user's profile. During subsequent logins, users must verify their identity with a live selfie. Once authenticated, users can create or join chat groups, invite others via email, and communicate using both text and voice (with real-time speech-to-text conversion using the Google Speech-to-Text API).

## Features

- **User Authentication with Face Matching:**  
  - Sign-up with name, email, password, and selfie registration.
  - Login requires both traditional credentials and a real-time facial verification.
  - Integration with AWS Rekognition for secure face matching.

- **Chat Rooms & Messaging:**  
  - Create chat rooms and invite members.
  - Real-time messaging using WebSockets (Socket.IO).
  - Persistent message storage using Redis to maintain conversation history.

- **Speech-to-Text Integration:**  
  - Record audio messages that are transcribed to text using the Google Speech-to-Text API.
  - Option to review and edit transcriptions before sending.

- **Real-Time Communication:**  
  - WebSocket server handles three main events: user identification, room joining, and chat messaging.
  - Instant broadcasting of messages to all room participants.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - Next.js for UI rendering and API routes.
  - Webcam integration for capturing selfies during sign-up and login.
  - Chat UI with text and speech-to-text capabilities.

- **Backend:**  
  - Next.js API routes for handling authentication, face matching, chat room management, and message storage.
  - Node.js server for real-time communication using WebSockets.
  - Redis for persistent session and message storage.
  
- **Third-Party Integrations:**  
  - **AWS Rekognition:** Face recognition and matching.
  - **Google Speech-to-Text API:** Converting recorded audio into text.

- **Deployment:**  
  - Vercel for front-end deployment.
  - Environment variables securely managed through platform-specific settings.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Redis instance (local or hosted)
- AWS account with Rekognition permissions
- Google Cloud account with Speech-to-Text API enabled

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-chat-app.git
   cd your-chat-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

   ```env
   # Redis configuration
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_url

   # WebSocket Server Port
   WS_PORT=8080

   # AWS Credentials
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
   AWS_REGION=your_aws_region

   # Google Speech-to-Text API Key
   GOOGLE_SPEECH_API_KEY=your_google_api_key

   # Additional configurations as needed...
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   - **For Development:**
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     ```

   - **For Production Build:**
     ```bash
     npm run build
     npm start
     # or equivalent yarn commands
     ```

## Environment Variables

- **REDIS_URL:** Connection string for your Redis instance.
- **WS_PORT:** Port on which the WebSocket server runs.
- **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION:** Credentials for AWS Rekognition.
- **GOOGLE_SPEECH_API_KEY:** API key for the Google Speech-to-Text service.

## Usage

1. **User Registration:**
   - Sign up with your name, email, and password.
   - Grant camera access to capture a selfie.
   - The captured image is processed via AWS Rekognition for future verification.

2. **User Login:**
   - Enter your username and password.
   - A new real-time selfie is captured and matched against the stored image.
   - On successful verification, you are directed to the main dashboard.

3. **Chat Rooms & Messaging:**
   - Create a new chat room and invite members via email.
   - Upon invitation acceptance, join the chat room.
   - Send messages as text or record audio that is transcribed into text.

4. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - WebSocket events manage user identification, joining rooms, and live message broadcasting.
   - Redis ensures message persistency and quick access to recent chat history.

## WebSocket Server Details

The WebSocket server (located in `websocket-server/server.js`) handles the following:

- **User Identification:**  
  On connection, the client sends an "identify" event which maps the user ID to the active WebSocket connection.

- **Room Joining:**  
  The "join-room" event assigns the user to a chat room. The server stores this information in Redis for persistence and logs room participation.

- **Chat Messaging:**  
  The "chat-message" event broadcasts messages to all participants in the room. Each message is stamped with a unique ID and a timestamp before broadcasting.

The server also includes robust logging and error handling to monitor client connections, message flows, and Redis operations.

## API Endpoints & Routes

- **User Authentication:**
  - `POST /api/signup` – Handles user registration, including face capture and storage.
  - `POST /api/login` – Handles login by verifying credentials and live face capture.

- **Chat Room Management:**
  - `POST /api/chat/create` – Creates a new chat room.
  - `POST /api/chat/invite` – Sends an invitation email to join a chat room.
  - `GET /api/chat/messages` – Retrieves past chat messages from the database (Redis).

- **Speech-to-Text:**
  - `POST /api/speech/convert` – Converts recorded audio to text using the Google Speech-to-Text API.

  Can be deployed on a Node.js hosting service or alongside the frontend if architecture permits. Ensure the WS_PORT and other environment variables are correctly set.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced UI/UX:**  
  Implement responsive design and advanced chat features like file sharing and notifications.

- **Improved Security:**  
  Add multi-factor authentication and more rigorous logging for face recognition processes.

- **Analytics & Monitoring:**  
  Integrate real-time analytics for chat activities and performance monitoring for the WebSocket server.

- **Mobile Support:**  
  Develop native mobile applications using React Native or Flutter.
